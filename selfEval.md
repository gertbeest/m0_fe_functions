# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?
    -I am terrible at time management, apparently, as I am finding out while trying to complete Mod 0 (ADHD does come with time blindness). I lose hours and hours to the homework because it takes me a much longer time to complete it than I plan for. I could use any pointers other ADHDers have, or honestly any neurotypical person's way of dealing with time management.

- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?
    -A function is a set of instructions for a computer program to follow. It's a resuable chunk of code that takes in 0 or more arguments, does some work, and possibly returns a value.

- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.
    -Arguments: are the actual data we provide to the function. It has to be in the form of a string, boolean, or number.
    -Parameters: act like variables that can be accessed inside a function. They tell you which arguments you can pass to a function.

- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to being to your Small Group?
    -The anatomy of a function is still really fuzzy to me. I need some sort of pictorial visual or something to illustrate one properly. Maybe someone in the small group has a better understanding they can share with me.
